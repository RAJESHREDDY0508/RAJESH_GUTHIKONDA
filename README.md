👋 Hi, I'm @RAJESH_GUTHIKONDA

👀 I'm interested in Full Stack Software Engineering, with a focus on building secure, scalable applications using Java/Spring Boot, Microservices, and Cloud/DevOps tools like AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes. I'm also keenly interested in creating new technologies and developing my skills.


🌱 I'm currently learning Python, Azure Data Engineer concepts, and Full Stack applications in Machine Learning and AI. I have hands-on experience with technologies including Java 17, the Spring Boot ecosystem, Angular/React, Node.js, and Python.


💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Software Technologies projects, especially those involving end-to-end ownership across design, development, testing, and cloud delivery of robust systems. My professional experience spans banking, insurance, and platform engineering.
